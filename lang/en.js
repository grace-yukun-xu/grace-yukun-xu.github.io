    <p> Hi! Welcome to my personal website. I'm Grace, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Curriculum, Instruction, and Science of Learning program at the University at Buffalo. 
    My master's degree was in Learning Design and Technology at Stanford University, and I double majored in Elementary Education and Child Development during my undergrad at Vanderbilt University. 
    My research interest is in exploring how young children, particularly those in grades K-2, interact with technology in classroom settings. I'm also interested in designing (and researching) technology-enhanced learning environments that empower young students to learn about the world and about themselves. 
    </p>
